			\section*{Profile}
			Passionate about programming and learning new technologies. I have gathered experiences as software developer mostly in the field of Automotive and Automation Systems. From both fields I have learnt how to make reliable and safe software and hardware components. \newline
			I have developed projects started from making specifications and requirements through making software and hardware component to documentation and delivery. \newline
			I like to work indepedently but also I consider myself as a team player especially when a project requires other engineering fields to be merged.

			\section*{Education}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item{
					\textbf{Óbuda University - KVK} \\
					\emph{Electrical Engineer (BSc.)} \\
					\emph{2015 - 2019} \\
					\emph{Specialisation: Automation - Embedded Systems expert} \\
					\emph{Classification of the qualification: Outstanding}

			\section*{Experiences}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item{
					\textbf{Electronics Development Engineer} \\	
					\emph{Unix Autó Kft., Budapest, 1139} \\
					\newline I was the part of the Research and Development team. The main portfolio of the department was warehouse automation system development. \\
					\newline \underline{I was responsible for:}
					\begin{itemize}
						\item{specificate and making requirements about the project and calculate deadlines for each individual tasks}
						\item{design circuit in Altium or KiCAD with 2 or 4 layers of PCB (THT and SMD components as well)}
						\item{search and order required components and keeping contact with suppliers}
						\item{developing source code for STM32 development boards (or Raspberry Pi)}
						\item{Making unit test framework for functional testing and lifetime testing hardware components}
						\item{Prepare user guide or assembly guide for technicians (with Latex and UML)}
					\end{itemize}
					
					\textbf{Projects:} \\
				    \newline \textbf{Robot arm positioning with computer vision:} I was developing QR Code detection algorithm with the help of OpenCV in C++. The QR code was responsible to show the middle point of an object. If the center point was found then the coordinates were sent via CAN to a STM32 control board and the robot arm was moving according to that. \\
